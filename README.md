# z12

The z12 module is an implementation of the algorithm discussed here by Miller Puckette:

http://msp.ucsd.edu/Publications/seamus15.pdf

The gist of it is a stochastic sequencer, containing 8 probabilistic outputs.

### Parameters [8]

8 probabilities, one for each gate.

### Input [9]

1 external clock input.

8 inputs to modify the probabilities automatically. When these are connected the knobs are bypassed.

### Output [8]

8 outputs, one for each gate/trigger.

I welcome Issues and Pull Requests to this repository if you have suggestions for improvement.

I only ask that you give credit to my module if you use it in a creative project.
